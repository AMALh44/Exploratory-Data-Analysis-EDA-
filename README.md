# Exploratory Data Analysis and Regression Model Application

## Description
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and a regression model applied to a dataset. The project demonstrates how to preprocess data, analyze patterns, and build predictive models to uncover insights. The dataset and associated scripts provide a hands-on approach for understanding regression techniques and their practical applications.

## Features
- Comprehensive EDA with visualization techniques
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Regression model implementation and evaluation
- Insightful documentation and reproducible scripts

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AMALh44/Regression.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd eda-regression
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Place your dataset in the `data` folder.
2. Run the EDA script:
   ```bash
   python eda_script.py
   ```
3. Train and evaluate the regression model:
   ```bash
   python regression_model.py
   ```
4. Review the generated results and visualizations in the `results` folder.
